# IPP project
IPPCode23 parser and interpret for IPP course at FIT BUT.

If you're brave enough to inspect the interpret source code, good luck with not losing your sanity (it's the ugliest code I've ever written - it was a speedrun and was completed in 16 hours).
It's probably good to note that control flow instructions don't work - were not implemented at all.
